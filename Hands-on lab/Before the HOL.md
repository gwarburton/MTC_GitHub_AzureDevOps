# OSS PaaS and DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

   - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

2. Linux virtual machine configured with:

   - Visual Studio Code
   - Azure CLI
   - Docker
   - Node.js and npm
   - MongoDB Community Edition

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.

> **IMPORTANT**: Many Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Resource groups**, select **+Add**, and then enter the following in the Create an empty resource group blade:

    - **Name**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.
    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group location**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, + Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and \"hands-on-labs\" is entered into the Resource group name textbox on the Resource Group, Create an empty resource group blade.](media/create-resource-group.png "Azure Portal")

2. Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create a development virtual machine

In this task, you will provision a Linux virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, which will be used as your development machine throughout this lab. The VM will be created using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template from a GitHub repository. The ARM template includes a custom extension script which installs Docker, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), MongoDB, and other required software on the VM. The ARM template also adds an inbound port rule that opens port 3389 on the network security group for the VM to allow RDP connections.

> If you would like to review the steps to manually provision the VM and installed software, see [Appendix A](./Appendix-A).

1. To open a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal select the Deploy to Azure button below:

    <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FMCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2Flab-files%2FLabVM%2Fazure-deploy.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>

2. On the custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, enter the following:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
    - **Location**: Select the location you used for the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.
    - **Virtual Machine Name**: Accept the default value, LabVM.
    - **Admin Username**: Accept the default value, demouser.
    - **Admin Password**: Accept the default value, Password.1!!
    - Check the box to agree to the Azure Marketplace terms and conditions.
    - Select **Purchase**.

    ![The Custom deployment blade displays, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

3. It can take about 20 minutes to deploy the Lab VM. You can move on to the next task while the VM is deploying.

### Task 3: Provision a Jenkins server

In this task, you will provision an Azure Linux VM, which will serve as your Jenkins server for this hands-on lab.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**, enter "Jenkins" into the **Search the Marketplace** box, select the **Jenkins** compute item from the results, and then select **Create**.

    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, and Everything is highlighted to the right. On the Everything blade to the right, jenkins is highlighted in the search box, and the Jenkins row is highlighted in the search results.](media/create-resource-jenkins.png "Azure Portal")

2. On the **Create Jenkins Basics** blade, enter the following:

    - **Name:** Enter **Jenkins**
    - **User name:** Enter **jenkinsadmin**
    - **Authentication type:** Select **Password**
    - **Password:** Enter **Password.1!!**
    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group:** Select Create new, and enter "jenkins-SUFFIX" (Note: Jenkins will use a different resource group than the other resources in this lab).
    - **Location:** Select the location you are using for resources in this hands-on lab.
    - Select **OK** to proceed to the **Settings** blade.

    ![Basics is selected on the Create Jenkins blade, and the information above is entered on the Basics blade at right.](media/create-jenkins-basics.png "Configure settings on the Create Jenkins Basics blade")

3. On the **Additional Settings** blade:

    - **Subnets**: Select **Configure subnets**, and then select **OK** on the **Subnets** blade to accept the defaults.
    - **Domain name label**: Enter a unique value, such as **jenkins-SUFFIX**.
    - **Jenkins release type**: Select **LTS**.
    - **JDK Type**: Select **Zulu**.

4. Select **OK** to proceed to the Integration Settings screen.

    ![Additional Settings is selected on the Create Jenkins blade, SSD and Subnets are selected on the Additional Settings blade in the middle, and OK is selected on the Subnets blade at right.](media/create-jenkins-additional-settings.png "Proceed to the summary screen")

5. On the **Integration Settings** blade, select **OK**.

    ![Integration Settings is selected on the Create Jenkins blade. On the Jenkins Integration Settings blade to the right, VM is selected, and OK is selected at the bottom.](media/create-jenkins-integration-settings.png "Select OK on the Jenkins Integration Settings blade")

6. On the **Summary** blade, ensure the `Validation passed` message is displayed, and then select **OK**.

    ![Summary is selected on the Create Jenkins blade. Validation information is displayed on the Summary blade to the right, and OK is selected at the bottom.](media/create-jenkins-summary.png "Ensure that validation passed")

    ![Buy is selected on the Create Jenkins blade. Provisioning information is displayed on the Create blade to the right, and Create is selected at the bottom.](media/create-jenkins-buy.png "Provision the Jenkins server")

8. It can take 10+ minutes for the VM to provision. You can move on to the next task while you wait.

### Task 4: Create GitHub account

In this task, you will sign up for a free GitHub account, which will be used for hosting a copy of the sample application used throughout this lab. This account will be integrated into the CI/CD workflow for pushing updates to the application into Azure.

> **NOTE**: If you already have a GitHub account, and wish to use that account, you can skip to the [next task](#task-5-fork-the-starter-app).

1. Navigate to <https://github.com> in a web browser.

2. In the form on the page, enter a **username**, your **email** address, and a **password**, then select **Sign up for GitHub**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the sign-up form on github.com.](media/github-signup.png "Sign up for GitHub")

3. On the Welcome to GitHub screen, select **Unlimited public repositories free** under **Choose your personal plan**, and select **Continue**.

    ![Unlimited public repositories free is selected under Choose your personal plan on the Welcome to GitHub screen.](media/github-welcome.png "Select Unlimited public repositories free")

4. On the next screen, you can select options to tailor your experience and select **Submit**, or select **skip this step**, next to **Submit,** to complete your registration.

    ![Very experienced, Development, and I'm a professional are selected in Step 2 on the Welcome to GitHub screen.](media/github-experience.png "Select options in Step 2")

### Task 5: Fork the starter app

In this task, you will fork the [OSS PaaS and DevOps MCW GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps) to create a copy of the starter application in your GitHub account.

> As part of this workshop, you will be linking a Jenkins Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline to your GitHub repo and committing code changes into that forked repo. To do this, you must create a copy of the starter application in a repo where you have permissions to commit changes.

1. Log into your GitHub account, and then navigate to the [OSS PaaS and DevOps MCW GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps).

2. At the top right of the projects GitHub page, select **Fork**.

    ![Fork is highlighted at the top right of the projects GitHub page.](media/github-fork.png "Select Fork")

3. If you have more than one GitHub account, select the account you are using for this hands-on lab.

4. This will start the process of making a copy of the repo and starter application into your GitHub account, in a repository named **MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps**.

5. Once completed the project page will open.

    ![The Code tab is highlighted on this screenshot of the project page. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/github-repo.png "Screenshot of the project page")

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
